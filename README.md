## Code Guide

The purpose of this section is to give a broad overview of the website code and provide necessary documentation for developers that are working on this project.

### Languages

Symphony is built on PHP with XSLT providing the templating language to provide views to work with data that is modeled in `Sections` and controlled via `Data Sources`.

On the front-end we are leveraging the following:

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): this powerful builder helps combine and minify LESS into CSS as well as concat and minify JS files
- [Bootstrap 2.3](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/): the current version of this site is built on Bootstrap 2.3's LESS implementation, which is built via Grunt (see above)
